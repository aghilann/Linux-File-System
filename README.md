# File System

## User Stories

This application is made to mimic the **functionality of a file system**.
There is no real target audience for this project, 
but it is a good starting point for learning how to use the **file system** works.
This project interests me since I think the recursive nature of the file system would make 
this project difficult to implement and it will teach me a lot aboout Object Oriented Programming.
